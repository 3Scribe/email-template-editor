You are implementing a GitHub Issue in an existing repository.

Execution Rules:
- Implement ONLY what is described in the Acceptance Criteria.
- Do NOT introduce backend, API routes, databases, or external services.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated files.
- Prefer simple and readable implementations over abstraction.
- Keep changes localized to new folders where possible.
- Ensure the project builds and runs with `npm run dev`.
- If assumptions are required, choose the simplest option.
- After completion:
  1. Summarize files created or modified
  2. List manual testing steps
  3. Identify any follow-up work

Work incrementally and safely.
